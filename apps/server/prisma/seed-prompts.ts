**Idea Quality Assessment:**

- Overly broad or vague targeting that reduces focus
- Solutions that are "nice to have" rather than "must have"
- Competitive advantages that can be easily replicated
- Business models that don't align with target persona behavior
- Technical complexity that exceeds startup execution capacity

- Persona specificity and pain point clarity
- Solution uniqueness and defensibility
- Market timing and competitive positioning
- Business model alignment with user behavior
- Execution roadmap and resource requirements

Return a focused refinement prompt that addresses the most important improvements needed.`
