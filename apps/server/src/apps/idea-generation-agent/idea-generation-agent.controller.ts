			**Your critical filter:** The identified problems MUST be:

				2.  **Solvable for a Lean Startup:** The problem should realistically be addressed by a focused MVP from a small team, implying it's not a multi-billion dollar R&D challenge.

(e.g., if 6G is trending, a *current* problem might be businesses struggling with outdated 5G hardware *in light of* impending 6G standards, or planning complexity for future tech investments).

				- They are too generic or rigid to adapt to the new trend's *immediate* demands?
				- They create more friction or cost *now* in the evolving environment?
				- They completely miss a critical *current* need created by the trend's influence?

You will leverage the identified global trend, the specific commercial problems, the competitive gaps, and the monetization strategy to craft a cohesive, compelling business concept.

			**Your core responsibility is to articulate a precise problem solved for a specific group of people with a uniquely compelling, *buildable* solution. Focus on a solution that is realistic for a focused, early-stage team to develop and bring to market, which often means micro-SaaS, specialized tools, or niche service plays.**

			**Tone & Narrative:** Absolutely **avoid abstract jargon and generic buzzwords.** Use vivid, relatable, and *intriguing* language that makes someone *feel* the problem and *see* the solution in action. Every part of the output should read like a concise, inspiring blueprint for a real product launch, delivered with the persuasive, human tone of a visionary founder.

			**Title Format:** The title should be descriptive, clearly indicating the product's function, target, or key benefit. It should be immediately understandable and compelling. **Optionally, you may add '($XM ARR potential)'** at the end if the ARR estimate from monetization is particularly compelling and realistic for a focused micro-SaaS.
				*Examples:* 'Smart Sunscreen Wristband for Kids', 'AI-Powered Sketch-to-3D Tool for SMB Architects', 'Automated Compliance Assistant for Freelance Consultants'.

			**Narrative Quality:** The 'description', 'problemSolution', and 'executiveSummary' fields must tell a compelling, empathetic story.
				- Introduce the *specific user archetype* (e.g., 'a busy e-commerce manager' or 'a small accounting firm owner') and their *acute pain*.
				- Describe *how your product uniquely and delightfully solves it*.
				- Implicitly convey the 'why now' (how the larger trend makes this solution critical) and the vision for growth, similar to the engaging 'SunBuddy' example.

			**Actionability & Next Steps:**
			- For 'executionPlan': Provide concrete, exciting next steps for building and launching the MVP.
			- For 'tractionSignals': Suggest tangible, early indicators of success to look for.
			- For 'frameworkFit': Explain how this idea aligns with a recognized startup framework or investment thesis, making it strategically sound.
