				1.  **Acute & Present:** Happening in the market today, not a theoretical future issue.
				2.  **IMMEDIATELY SOLVABLE FOR A LEAN SOFTWARE-FOCUSED STARTUP:** This is CRUCIAL. The solution implied by the problem must be primarily **SOFTWARE-BASED (SaaS, API, web/mobile app)** or a **LIGHT SERVICE**. It **MUST NOT** require:

					*   **Deep scientific R&D (e.g., new materials, genetic engineering, novel brain interfaces, quantum computing hardware).**
					*   **Lengthy, multi-year regulatory approvals (e.g., FDA for novel medical devices).**
					*   **Billions in funding.**
					*   **Years of clinical trials.**
				3.  **Directly or Indirectly Influenced by the Trend:** The trend should act as the *catalyst* or *intensifier* for this *current* problem, making it urgent and commercially viable for a new solution.
				4.  **GENUINELY NOVEL:** The problems and implied solutions should feel *new* and *different*, building on the trend in a way that avoids previous idea categories.
			
			For each problem, dissect *why* existing solutions or traditional methods are utterly failing *in today's context*. Is it:
				- They are too generic or rigid to adapt to the new trend's *immediate* demands?
				- They create more friction or cost *now* in the evolving environment?
				- They completely miss a critical *current* need created by the trend's influence?

You will leverage the identified global trend, the specific commercial problems, the competitive gaps, and the monetization strategy to craft a cohesive, compelling business concept.

			**Your core responsibility: Articulate a precise problem solved for a specific group of people with a uniquely compelling, *primarily SOFTWARE-BASED (SaaS, API, web/mobile app)* or *LIGHT SERVICE* solution. The solution MUST be realistic for a focused, early-stage team to develop and bring to market. This means:**
				*   **NO custom hardware, robotics, medical devices, or advanced physical products.**
				*   **NO solutions requiring massive R&D, clinical trials, or multi-year regulatory approvals (e.g., FDA).**
				*   **Focus on leveraging existing, commercially available tech, APIs, or data.**

Every part of the output should read like a concise, inspiring blueprint for a real product launch, delivered with the persuasive, human tone of a visionary founder talking to their early team.

It should be immediately understandable and compelling, like a catchy product name or a direct solution statement. **DO NOT ALWAYS INCLUDE '($XM ARR potential)'. Only add it if the ARR estimate is truly outstanding and makes the title significantly more compelling; otherwise, omit it for brevity and authenticity.**
				*Examples:* 'AI Inventory Manager for Small Retailers', 'Automated Compliance Assistant for Freelance Consultants', 'Smart Task Orchestrator for Event Planners'.
			
			**Narrative Quality:** The 'description', 'problemSolution', and 'executiveSummary' fields must tell a compelling, empathetic story.
				- Introduce the *specific user archetype* (e.g., 'a busy e-commerce manager' or 'a small accounting firm owner') and their *acute pain* using honest, direct language.
				- Describe *how your software/service uniquely and delightfully solves it* with clear, tangible benefits.
				- Implicitly convey the 'why now' (how the larger trend makes this solution critical) and the honest vision for growth.
			
			**Actionability & Next Steps:**
			- For 'executionPlan': Provide concrete, exciting, and *realistic for a software startup* next steps for building and launching the MVP, including honest initial user acquisition strategy.
			- For 'tractionSignals': Suggest tangible, *achievable for a software product* early indicators of success to look for in the first 3-6 months. Use specific, quantifiable metrics that matter. No vanity metrics.
