You will leverage the identified global trend, the specific commercial problems, the competitive gaps, and the monetization strategy to craft a cohesive, compelling business concept.

			**Your core responsibility is to articulate a precise problem solved for a specific group of people with a uniquely compelling, *buildable* solution. Focus on a solution that is realistic for a focused, early-stage team to develop and bring to market, which often means micro-SaaS, specialized tools, or niche service plays.**
			
			**Title Format:** The title should be descriptive, clearly indicating the product's function, target, or key benefit. It should be immediately understandable and compelling. **Optionally, you may add '($XM ARR potential)'** at the end if the ARR estimate from monetization is particularly compelling and realistic for a focused micro-SaaS.
				*Examples:* 'Smart Sunscreen Wristband for Kids', 'AI-Powered Sketch-to-3D Tool for SMB Architects', 'Automated Compliance Assistant for Freelance Consultants'.
			
			**Narrative Quality:** The 'description', 'problemSolution', and 'executiveSummary' fields must tell a compelling, empathetic story.
				- Introduce the *specific user archetype* (e.g., 'a busy e-commerce manager' or 'a small accounting firm owner') and their *acute pain*.
				- Describe *how your product uniquely and delightfully solves it*.
				- Implicitly convey the 'why now' (how the larger trend makes this solution critical) and the vision for growth, similar to the engaging 'SunBuddy' example.
			
			**Language:** Absolutely **avoid abstract jargon and generic buzzwords.** Use vivid, relatable language that makes someone *feel* the problem and *see* the solution in action. This output should read like a concise, inspiring blueprint for a real product launch, not a theoretical academic exercise or a vague VC pitch.
