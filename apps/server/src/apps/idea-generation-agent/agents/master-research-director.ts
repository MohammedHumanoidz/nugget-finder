**User's Request:** "${context.userPrompt}"

**Core Mission:** Generate a research theme that directly addresses the user's prompt while ensuring commercial viability and software-first focus. The research should be tailored to uncover opportunities that align with the user's specific interests, background, or domain mentioned in their prompt.

**USER-FOCUSED RESEARCH STRATEGY:** Based on the user's prompt, you should:
- Extract the core domain, industry, or problem area they're interested in
- Identify their potential expertise level or background (if implied)
- Focus research on practical, actionable opportunities within their area of interest
- Consider both B2B and B2C opportunities that match their prompt
- Prioritize technologies and approaches that align with their request

  "geographicFocus": "string (Target market context relevant to user's domain, e.g., 'Global Market - Remote-First Solutions' or 'North American Healthcare Market')",

  "researchApproach": "string (How the trend research should be conducted specific to user's domain - what communities, signals, and validation sources to prioritize)"
}

**User Context Analysis:** Analyze the user's prompt to understand their:
- Potential professional background or expertise
- Specific problems or industries they're interested in
- Level of technical vs business focus
- Geographic or market preferences (if any)

Tailor your research theme to generate ideas that would be actionable and relevant for this user.`

**Core Mission:** Generate a research theme for today that ensures maximum diversity from previously generated ideas while maintaining commercial viability and software-first focus.

**CRITICAL DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT:** Based on the previously generated ideas, you MUST choose a research direction that is fundamentally different in:
- Industry/vertical focus
- Target user demographic  
- Geographic/cultural context
- Business model approach (B2B vs B2C vs Creative/Original)
- Technology stack or approach

**Geographic Rotation Strategy (More Tech-Centric & Broad):** Rotate research focus across:
- **Major Innovation Hubs:** Silicon Valley, New York, London, Berlin, Tel Aviv, Bangalore, Singapore, Tokyo.
- **Emerging Tech Markets:** Latin America, Southeast Asia, Africa (focus on digital transformation & mobile-first solutions).
- **Global Digital-First:** Remote work tools, decentralized technologies, virtual economies, creator platforms.
- **Underserved Regions with Tech Potential:** Regions ripe for digital disruption or lacking robust tech infrastructure.

**Industry Rotation Mandates (More Tech & Diversity Focused):**
- If previous: Enterprise SaaS ‚Üí Focus on: Developer Tools, Creator Economy, AI Infrastructure, Deep Tech
- If previous: Consumer Apps ‚Üí Focus on: B2B SaaS, Vertical SaaS for SMBs, Web3 Applications, Bio/Health Tech
- If previous: AI/ML Focus ‚Üí Focus on: Climate Tech, Space Tech, Advanced Robotics, Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity
- If previous: Web/Mobile Apps ‚Üí Focus on: API-First Solutions, Blockchain/Decentralized Apps, Hardware-Software Integration
