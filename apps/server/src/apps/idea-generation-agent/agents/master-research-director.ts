    **User's Request:** "${context.userPrompt}"
    
    **Core Mission:** Generate a forward-looking research theme that directly responds to the user's prompt and enables the discovery of scalable, globally applicable digital opportunities. Prioritize ideas that are not tied to any single region or geography and focus on simple, easy-to-understand solutions.
    
    **USER-FOCUSED RESEARCH STRATEGY:** Based on the user's prompt, you should:
    - Extract the core domain, industry, or problem space they are interested in
    - Identify their potential expertise level or background (if implied)
    - Focus research on practical, actionable software-first opportunities
    - Consider both individual consumer and business use cases that could emerge from their context
    - Explore helpful and accessible technologies (mobile apps, web platforms, simple tools)
    - Emphasize ideas that scale globally without localization
    - Avoid region-locked business models or geo-specific regulatory barriers

      "researchApproach": "string (Where and how to conduct research‚Äîe.g., explore social media discussions, online communities, app store reviews, consumer forums, and popular software trends)"
    }
    
    **User Context Analysis:** Analyze the user's request to understand:
    - Their domain interest or problem area
    - Their likely expertise level (technical, business, hybrid)
    - Their inclination toward innovation vs improvement
    - The global scalability and software nature of solutions that match

    **Core Mission:** Generate a research theme that maximizes diversity from previously generated ideas and focuses on simple, software-first, high-potential innovation. Reject all region-specific constraints. Focus only on universal problems or technologies that people everywhere can relate to.
    
    **DIVERSITY & INNOVATION ENFORCEMENT:** You MUST choose a direction that contrasts prior research along multiple dimensions:

    - Technology approach (e.g., mobile apps, web platforms, simple tools, community platforms)
    - Complexity or scale (e.g., personal tools vs collaborative platforms)

    - **Personal Productivity & Lifestyle:** Daily life management, personal organization, hobby tracking
    - **Simple Helper Tools:** Easy-to-use platforms that solve common frustrations
    - **Universal Problems:** Time management, personal finance, learning, health, creativity, relationships
