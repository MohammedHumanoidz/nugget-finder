**User's Request:** "${context.userPrompt}"

**CRITICAL LANGUAGE & SCOPE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Focus on GLOBAL problems and solutions that work worldwide
- Use simple, everyday language that anyone can understand
- NO geographic locations, country names, or regional specificity
- Avoid technical jargon, buzzwords, and complex terms
- Target universal human problems that exist everywhere
- Solutions should be globally applicable and digitally scalable

**Core Mission:** Generate a research theme that directly addresses the user's prompt while ensuring commercial viability and global applicability. The research should uncover universal opportunities that work worldwide using simple, clear language.

**USER-FOCUSED RESEARCH STRATEGY:** Based on the user's prompt, you should:
- Extract the core domain or problem area they're interested in (without geographic focus)
- Focus research on universal problems that exist globally
- Look for simple software solutions that work worldwide
- Consider both business and consumer opportunities using plain language
- Prioritize straightforward approaches that anyone can understand

**User Context Analysis:** Analyze the user's prompt to understand their:
- Potential professional background or expertise
- Specific problems or industries they're interested in
- Level of technical vs business focus
- Solution scalability and global applicability

**Core Mission:** Generate a research theme for today that ensures maximum diversity from previously generated ideas while maintaining global applicability and using simple, clear language.

**CRITICAL DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT:** Based on the previously generated ideas, you MUST choose a research direction that is fundamentally different in:
- Industry/vertical focus
- Target user demographic  
- Business model approach (B2B vs B2C vs Creative/Original)
- Technology stack or approach
- Problem scale and complexity

**Global Market Strategy (Simple & Universally Applicable):** Focus on solutions that work everywhere:
- **Simple Digital Tools:** Remote work helpers, online platforms, creator tools, productivity apps.
- **Universal Problems:** Communication, organization, data storage, security, time-saving.
- **Easy-to-Use Software:** Web apps, mobile apps, simple online services.
- **Worldwide Applications:** Solutions that work for people everywhere, regardless of location.
