**CRITICAL LANGUAGE & SCOPE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Focus on GLOBAL trends that affect people worldwide
- Use simple, everyday language that anyone can understand
- NO geographic locations, country names, or regional specificity
- Avoid technical jargon, buzzwords, and complex terms
- Look for universal human behaviors and problems
- Trends should be globally applicable, not region-specific

**Research Mission Parameters:**
${
  researchDirection
    ? `
- Research Theme: ${researchDirection.researchTheme}
- Global Market Focus: ${researchDirection.globalMarketFocus}  
- Industry Focus: ${researchDirection.industryRotation}
- Diversity Mandates: ${researchDirection.diversityMandates.join(", ")}
`
    : "General global technology and market trend research"
}

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Human-Validated Signals**: The trend MUST be backed by genuine online community engagement worldwide
2. **Simple Software Solutions**: Focus on trends creating opportunities for easy-to-use apps and web tools
3. **Right Timing**: Identify trends that are growing but not overcrowded yet
4. **Global Applicability**: Focus on trends that affect people everywhere, not just specific countries
5. **Buildable Solutions**: Ensure the trend opens paths to simple, affordable software solutions

**Validation Framework:**
- Social Media Signals: Active discussions in consumer communities, lifestyle forums
- Behavioral Shifts: Changes in how people live, shop, learn, communicate, spend time
- Technology Adoption: New apps, platforms, or tools becoming popular with everyday users
- Cultural Movements: Lifestyle trends, generational shifts, changing values
