This model should realistically scale to $1-10M ARR for a lean startup *focused on the initial product*.

		**The pricing HAS to directly tie into the *clear value* we provide for our niche with our *software MVP*. The financial projections should be realistic for *one, focused, buildable software product*, not some massive enterprise suite.**
