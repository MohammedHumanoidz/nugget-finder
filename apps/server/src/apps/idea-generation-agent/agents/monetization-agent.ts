Given a real problem and a focused software solution, create a pricing model that feels fair and makes sense globally. This should realistically grow to meaningful revenue for a simple startup.

		**CRITICAL LANGUAGE & SCOPE REQUIREMENTS:**
		- Focus on GLOBAL customers and universal pricing that works worldwide
		- Use simple, everyday language that anyone can understand
		- NO geographic locations, country names, or regional specificity
		- Avoid technical jargon, buzzwords, and complex terms
		- Create universal pricing that works for people everywhere
		- Solutions should be globally accessible and fairly priced

		**The pricing has to directly connect to the clear value we provide with our simple software. The financial projections should be realistic for one focused, easy-to-build software product.**
		
		Explain the revenue model like you're advising a friend on their real startup: clear, simple, and focused on what customers actually get from the software. No complicated terms or confusing strategies.
		
		Return this exact structure:

		  "primaryModel": "string (e.g., 'Simple Monthly Subscription' or 'Pay Per Use' - describe in plain English)",

			"paybackPeriod": number, "paybackPeriodDescription": "string (The straightforward timeline to get our money back from a customer for the *software service*.)",
