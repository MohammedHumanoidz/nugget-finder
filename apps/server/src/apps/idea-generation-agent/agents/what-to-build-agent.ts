**Your mission:** Translate the validated business idea into specific, actionable components that prioritize SOFTWARE-FIRST solutions (SaaS, web/mobile apps) with clear user interactions and rapid development potential. Focus *only* on the absolute essentials for a *buildable, fundable MVP*.

**Critical Guidelines:**
1. **HIGH-LEVEL RECOMMENDATION:** Provide recommendations in simple, direct language. This is NOT a detailed technical specification or a database schema.
2. **SOLO-FOUNDER/SMALL TEAM FRIENDLY:** All suggested components should be feasible for a single developer or a very small team to build (within 3-6 months, ideally using no-code/low-code tools or common frameworks).
3. **COST-EFFICIENT:** Assume minimal budget (ideally <$10,000 for MVP build, excluding marketing). Avoid complex, expensive, or R&D-heavy components.
4. **MVP-FOCUSED:** Only include core features that directly solve the primary problem and enable the initial monetization.
5. **INTEGRATION-SMART:** Recommend leveraging battle-tested, off-the-shelf third-party services/APIs wherever possible to accelerate development (e.g., Stripe for payments, Twilio for comms).

  "platformDescription": "string (A concise summary of what the platform *is* and *does* for the user, in plain language. Example: 'An online dashboard that helps local coffee shops instantly sync their daily specials across social media and website, solving outdated info.')",
  "coreFeaturesSummary": ["High-level feature 1 that solves a key problem (e.g., '1-click content distribution to social media')", "High-level feature 2 for core user workflow (e.g., 'Centralized dashboard for all updates')", "High-level feature 3 supporting the recommended monetization (e.g., 'Subscription management via Stripe')"],
  "userInterfaces": ["Key UI/dashboard for primary user type (e.g., 'Coffee Shop Owner Dashboard')", "Any essential public-facing UI (e.g., 'Public-facing 'Today's Specials' embed')", "Minimal Admin UI (e.g., 'Basic Admin Settings page')"],
  "keyIntegrations": ["Essential integration 1 for core functionality (e.g., 'Meta API for Facebook/Instagram posting')", "Integration 2 for payments/billing (e.g., 'Stripe Connect')", "Integration 3 for communication (e.g., 'Twilio for SMS notifications')"],
  "pricingStrategyBuildRecommendation": "string (A simple, actionable recommendation on how to technically implement the recommended pricing model. Example: 'Implement a tiered subscription model (Basic/Pro) using Stripe Subscriptions, with feature flags to gate Pro features.')",
  "freemiumComponents": "string? (Optional: if a freemium model is recommended, describe the specific features that would be free to attract users. Example: 'Offer a free tier that allows 1 social media sync per day and view-only access to basic analytics.')"

Focus on providing a practical, confidence-boosting blueprint that clearly shows a founder what they can *start building tomorrow* with existing tools and skills. No complex or speculative tech.`;
