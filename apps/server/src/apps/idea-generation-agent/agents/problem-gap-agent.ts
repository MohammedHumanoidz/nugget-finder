**Enhanced Analysis Framework:**

**Problem Identification Criteria:**
1. **Acute & Present**: Problems happening RIGHT NOW, costing real money/time/opportunities daily
2. **Persona-Specific**: Focus on specific archetypes (e.g., "independent podcast creators with limited resources" vs "content creators generally")
3. **Software-Solvable**: Problems that can be addressed with SaaS, APIs, web/mobile apps, or lightweight services within <$10K MVP budget
4. **Trend-Amplified**: Problems that are intensified or newly created by the identified trend
5. **Quantifiable Impact**: Problems with measurable business impact (lost revenue, wasted time, competitive disadvantage)

**Systemic Analysis Requirements:**
- Why do existing solutions fundamentally fail for this specific persona?
- What structural/technological/market barriers prevent current players from solving this?
- How does the trend create new urgency or change the problem dynamics?
- What makes this persona underserved by current market offerings?

**Solution Viability Filter:**
- NO hardware, IoT, medical devices, or physical products
- NO regulatory/compliance-heavy solutions as primary value
- NO deep R&D, AI model training, or multi-year development
- YES to API integration, data processing, workflow automation, communication tools
- YES to mobile-first, web-based, or lightweight service solutions

Return enhanced JSON structure:
{
  "problems": [
    "Specific persona spends X hours/week on manual process Y, losing $Z in revenue/opportunities because existing tools fail to address [specific limitation] in their workflow, particularly acute in [geographic/industry context]",
    "Second persona problem with quantified impact and clear gap in current solutions",
    "Third persona problem if applicable, same specificity and business impact focus"
  ],
  "gaps": [
    {
      "title": "string (Precise gap title that hints at the missing software capability)",
      "description": "string (Detailed explanation of WHY existing software/methods fail for this specific persona in this trend context, including the mechanism of failure)",
      "impact": "string (Quantified business impact with specific metrics where possible)",
      "target": "string (Extremely narrow persona definition with geographic/industry context)",
      "opportunity": "string (Specific software solution that leverages the trend to solve this gap uniquely)"

Conduct deep systemic analysis to identify 2-3 excruciatingly specific commercial problems that are:
1. Currently happening (not future theoretical problems)
2. Costing specific business archetypes real money/time/opportunities TODAY
3. Intensified or newly created by this trend
4. Solvable with focused software solutions (SaaS/API/web app)
5. Underserved by existing market solutions

**Problem Discovery Focus:**
- Target specific personas within the trend's impact zone
- Quantify the pain (hours wasted, revenue lost, opportunities missed)
- Explain why current tools/methods fail for this specific use case
- Ensure problems lead to <$10K MVP, 3-6 month development solutions
