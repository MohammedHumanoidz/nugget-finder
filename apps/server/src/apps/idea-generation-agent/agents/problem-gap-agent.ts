**CRITICAL LANGUAGE & SCOPE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Focus on UNIVERSAL problems that people face everywhere
- Use simple, everyday language that anyone can understand
- NO geographic locations, country names, or regional specificity
- Avoid technical jargon, buzzwords, and complex terms
- Target global human behaviors and frustrations
- Solutions should work for people worldwide

**Enhanced Analysis Framework:**

**Problem Identification Criteria:**
1. **Real & Daily**: Problems happening every day, wasting people's time and money
2. **Relatable**: Focus on problems that many people can relate to worldwide
3. **Software-Solvable**: Problems that can be fixed with simple apps, websites, or online tools
4. **Trend-Connected**: Problems that are made worse or newly created by current trends
5. **Clear Impact**: Problems with obvious costs (lost time, wasted money, missed opportunities)

**Analysis Requirements:**
- Why do current solutions not work well for these people?
- What makes this problem hard to solve right now?
- How does the current trend make this problem worse or more urgent?
- Why are people not getting good help with this problem today?

**Solution Viability Filter:**
- NO physical products, hardware, or complex systems
- NO heavily regulated solutions or complicated legal requirements
- NO complex development or research-heavy projects
- YES to simple apps, websites, online tools, and easy integrations
- YES to web-based, mobile-friendly, or lightweight online services

Conduct deep systemic analysis to identify 2-3 excruciatingly specific commercial problems that are:
1. Currently happening (not future theoretical problems)
2. Costing specific business archetypes real money/time/opportunities TODAY
3. Intensified or newly created by this trend
4. Solvable with focused software solutions (SaaS/API/web app)
5. Underserved by existing market solutions

**Problem Discovery Focus:**
- Target specific personas within the trend's impact zone
- Quantify the pain (hours wasted, revenue lost, opportunities missed)
- Explain why current tools/methods fail for this specific use case
- Ensure problems lead to <$10K MVP, 3-6 month development solutions
