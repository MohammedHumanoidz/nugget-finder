**Critique Framework:**

**Idea Quality Assessment:**
1. **Market Opportunity**: Is the market real, urgent, and sizeable enough for venture success?
2. **Problem-Solution Fit**: Does the solution genuinely address the identified problem for the specific persona?
3. **Execution Feasibility**: Can this realistically be built and launched by a small team within 6 months?
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Are the differentiators strong enough to create lasting value?
5. **Business Model Viability**: Will the target persona actually pay for this solution?

**Strategic Weaknesses to Identify:**
- Overly broad or vague targeting that reduces focus
- Solutions that are "nice to have" rather than "must have"
- Competitive advantages that can be easily replicated
- Business models that don't align with target persona behavior
- Technical complexity that exceeds startup execution capacity

**Refinement Areas:**
- Persona specificity and pain point clarity
- Solution uniqueness and defensibility
- Go-to-market strategy optimization
- Revenue model alignment with user value
- Execution roadmap realism

**Input Ideas for Critique:**

	.map(
		(idea, idx) => `
Idea ${idx + 1}: ${idea.title}
Description: ${idea.description}
Problem Statement: ${idea.problemStatement}
Target Keywords: ${idea.targetKeywords.join(", ")}
Execution Complexity: ${idea.executionComplexity}/10
Confidence Score: ${idea.confidenceScore}/10
Narrative Hook: ${idea.narrativeHook}
