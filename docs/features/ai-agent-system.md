# AI Agent System

The core innovation of Nugget Finder is its sophisticated multi-agent AI system that breaks down business idea generation into specialized tasks, each handled by a dedicated AI agent with specific expertise and prompts.

## Overview

The AI agent system uses a master-coordinator pattern where a central "Research Director" orchestrates 8 specialized agents, each responsible for a specific aspect of business idea research and generation. This approach ensures comprehensive analysis while maintaining quality and consistency.

### Key Benefits
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on its domain of expertise
- **Parallel Processing**: Agents can work simultaneously for faster results
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple validation layers ensure high-quality output
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents or modify existing ones
- **Consistency**: Standardized outputs across all generated ideas

## üèóÔ∏è Agent Architecture

### Master Research Director

The **Master Research Director** serves as the orchestrator of the entire idea generation process. It coordinates all other agents and ensures the final output is coherent and actionable.

**Responsibilities:**
- Orchestrates the entire generation process
- Manages agent communication and data flow
- Ensures quality and consistency of outputs
- Handles error recovery and fallback strategies

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
interface MasterResearchDirector {
  async execute(context: AgentContext): Promise<SynthesizedIdea>;
  async coordinateAgents(agents: Agent[]): Promise<void>;
  async validateOutput(output: any): Promise<boolean>;
  async handleErrors(error: Error): Promise<void>;
}
```

    // Agent implementation
  }
}
```

2. **Update Master Research Director:**
```typescript
// Add to agent coordination
const newAgent = new NewAgent();
const result = await newAgent.execute(context);
```

3. **Add to Database Schema:**
```prisma
model NewAgentOutput {
  id String @id @default(uuid())
  // Agent-specific fields
  dailyIdeaId String @unique
  dailyIdea DailyIdea @relation(fields: [dailyIdeaId], references: [id])
}
```

```typescript
interface AgentConfig {
  name: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  timeout: number;

  temperature: number;
  maxTokens: number;
}
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Agent Learning**: Implement feedback loops for agent improvement
2. **Multi-Model Support**: Use different AI models for different agents
3. **Parallel Processing**: Run compatible agents in parallel
4. **Agent Specialization**: Create domain-specific agent variants
5. **Real-time Collaboration**: Allow agents to collaborate in real-time

### Scalability Considerations

- **Agent Pooling**: Maintain pools of agents for high availability
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute agent workloads across multiple instances
- **Caching**: Cache agent outputs for similar inputs
- **Cost Optimization**: Use cheaper models for simple tasks

This AI agent system provides the foundation for generating high-quality, validated startup ideas with comprehensive market analysis and implementation guidance.
